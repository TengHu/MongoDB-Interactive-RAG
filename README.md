# UPDATE

Took an outdated Interactive RAG demo and changed it to use MongoDB Atlas (along with a few other changes and prompt engineering).

# FLOW
1. Ask Question
2. Check VectorStore -> If nothing, google. If something, respond.
3. Add/Remove sources conversationally

# ReAct Prompt Technique + Chain of Thought
Generating reasoning traces allow the model to induce, track, and update action plans, and even handle exceptions.
This example uses ReAct combined with chain-of-thought (CoT).

[Chain of Thought](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot)

[Reasoning + Action](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react)

```
[EXAMPLES]
- User Input: What is MongoDB?
- Thought: I have to think step by step. I should not answer directly, let me check my available actions before responding.
- Observation: I have an action available "answer_question". I'll use that
- Action: "answer_question"('What is MongoDB?')

- User Input: Reset chat history
- Thought: I have to think step by step. I should not answer directly, let me check my available actions before responding.
- Observation: I have an action available "reset_messages". I'll use that
- Action: "reset_messages"()

- User Input: remove source https://www.google.com
- Thought: I have to think step by step. I should not answer directly, let me check my available actions before responding.
- Observation: I have an action available "remove_source". I'll use that
- Action: "remove_source"('https://www.google.com')

- User Input: read https://www.google.com, https://www.example.com
- Thought: I have to think step by step. I should not answer directly, let me check my available actions before responding.
- Observation: I have an action available "read_url". I'll use that
- Action: "read_url"(['https://www.google.com','https://www.example.com'])

# Interactive Retrieval Augmented Generation

This demo app uses [ActionWeaver](https://github.com/TengHu/ActionWeaver/tree/main) to organize and orchestrate tools/functions and implement an interactive RAG bot.

This demo app is not intended for use in production environments.

## Getting Started

To run the RAG application

```bash
streamlit run rag/app.py
```
Log information generated by the application will be appended to app.log.


This bot is designed to read and process content from URLs. 
It can answer questions based on the content it analyzes. 
If the bot is unable to provide an answer, it will initiate a Google search to find relevant information.

For a more in-depth understanding of how this bot works under the hood, please refer to the bot.py file. 
Additionally, you can explore the [ActionWeaver](https://github.com/TengHu/ActionWeaver/tree/main) repository for further details.
